Building the Search Engine:

This is a search engine built throughout the Udacity course of Introduction to Computer Science.
We will split the whole program into small functions while introducing new concepts supported with exercises along the way.

Throughout this course, we’ll build a search engine by learning about and producing key search engine components including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm. As we build these pieces, you’ll be learning about and practicing computer science skills that will ready me for intermediate level computer science courses.

I'm excited that I finished building the Search Engine using Python :) Cool feeling!
