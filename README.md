Building a Search Engine (composed of a Crawler, an Index Algorithm, and a Page Rank Algorithm):

Note: The search engine is in Beta Version. I used Python 2.7 to build it, and it can be found in "Lesson_4" folder.

This is a search engine built throughout the Udacity course of Introduction to Computer Science.
I split the whole program into small functions as I learned new concepts in this course, supported with exercises along the way.

Throughout this course, I built a search engine by learning about and producing key search engine components including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm. As I built these pieces (set of functions), I learned about practicing computer science skills that helped to ready me for intermediate level computer science courses.

I'm excited that I finally finished building the Search Engine using Python :) such a cool feeling!!
