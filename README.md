Building a Search Engine (composed of a Crawler, an Index Algorithm, and a Page Rank Algorithm):

Note: The search engine is in Beta Version and can be found in "Lesson_4" folder. 
And I used Python 2.7 to build it.

This is a search engine built throughout the Udacity course of Introduction to Computer Science.
We will split the whole program into small functions while introducing new concepts supported with exercises along the way.

Throughout this course, weâ€™ll build a search engine by learning about and producing key search engine components including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm. As I built these pieces (functions), I learned about practicing computer science skills that helped to ready me for intermediate level computer science courses.

I'm excited that I finally finished building the Search Engine using Python :) Cool feeling!!
